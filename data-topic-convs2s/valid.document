the country 's consumer watchdog has taken apple to court for false advertising because the tablet computer does not work on australia 's 4g network . apple 's lawyers said they were willing to publish a clarification . however the company does not accept that it misled customers . the australian competition and consumer commission -lrb- accc -rrb- said on tuesday : `` apple 's recent promotion of the new ` ipad with wi-fi + 4g ' is misleading because it represents to australian consumers that the product can , with a sim card , connect to a 4g mobile data network in australia , when this is not the case . '' the watchdog then lodged a complaint at the federal court in melbourne . at a preliminary hearing , apple lawyer paul anastassiou said apple had never claimed the device would work fully on the current 4g network operated by telstra . apple says the new ipad works on what is globally accepted to be a 4g network . the matter will go to a full trial on 2 may . the apple ipad 's third version went on sale earlier this month , with australia the first country where it was available . shoppers lined up by the hundreds at apple stores on opening day and the company said it had been its strongest ipad launch to date . the accc said it was seeking an injunction on sales as well as a financial penalty against apple , corrective advertising and refunds to consumers . on its website , apple does state that 4g lte is only supported on selected networks in the us and canada .
